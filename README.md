# RobotNavigation
SCITOS G5  Mobile Robot Navigation Task.
# Introduction

The data were collected as the SCITOS G5 navigates through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, To navigate, the robot uses 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its "waist".
The numbering of the ultrasound sensors contains the raw values of the measurements of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label . 
Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second. 
These 24 sensors were set 15° separated from one another 

Wall-following robots are used in many applications, including: Automation in industries, Military applications, Consumer applications, Cleaning processes, Domestic purposes

# Objective
Different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.
Multiclass Classification applied 

# Tools and Platform used
Tools:  Python, Tableau
Platform : Jupyter Notebook, aws cloud
Library Used : Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

# Classification
Class Distribution: 
-- Move-Forward: 2205 samples (40.41%).
-- Slight-Left-Turn : 826 samples (15.13%).
-- Sharp -Right-Turn : 328 samples (6.01%).
-- Slight-Right-Turn: 2097 samples (38.43%).
